# BJS-API
This repo has the goal to create a clean REST API for the [BJS](https://www.bundesjugendspiele.de/) with all needed things (user management, database, ...)

# Rules for development
- The API must be well documented in order to make development for other project smoothly
- In order to prevent bugs and errors the application must rely on automated (unit) tests
